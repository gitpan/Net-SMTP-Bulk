VERSION

SYNOPSIS
    This is a rewrite of Net::SMTP using AnyEvent and Coro as a backbone. It
    supports AUTH, SSL and STARTTLS as well. This module can be used as a
    drop in replacement for Net::SMTP. At this point this module is
    EXPIREMENTAL, so use at your own risk. Functionality can change at any
    time.
