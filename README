NAME
    Net::SMTP::Bulk - NonBlocking batch SMTP using Net::SMTP interface

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
    This is a rewrite of Net::SMTP using AnyEvent and Coro as a backbone. It
    supports AUTH and SSL (no STARTTLS support yet). This module can be used
    as a drop in replacement for Net::SMTP. At this point this module is
    EXPIREMENTAL, so use at your own risk. Functionality can change at any
    time.

        use Net::SMTP::Bulk;

        my $smtp = Net::SMTP::Bulk->new($server, %options);

    See Net::SMTP for syntax.
